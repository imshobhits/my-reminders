## About My Reminders

My Reminders was primarily written by three Atlassian developers. Here are some fun facts
about this service:

 - The service is written using Haskell via the [Snap Framework][1]. It is a robust service
   as a result.
 - The service is hosted in AWS so that your data is secure, backed up and highly avaliable.
 - Reminders are sent through Jira, the app needs write access to Jira in order to send these reminders.

If you want to see the service improved, or you want to raise a bug, then please [raise an issue for
us][2].
