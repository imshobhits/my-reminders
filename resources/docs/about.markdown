## About remind me for Cloud

Remind me for Cloud was primarily written by three Atlassian developers. Here are some fun facts
about this service:

 - The service is written using Haskell via the [Snap Framework][1]. It is a robust service
   as a result.
 - The service is hosted in AWS so that your data is secure, backed up and highly avaliable.
 - We integrate with the [Mailgun][2] service to send you emails. You can see if that service is
   currently operational by [checking their status page][3].

If you want to see the service improved, or you want to raise a bug, then please [raise an issue for
us][4].
