## What is Remind me for Cloud?

Imagine the following scenario:

> Alana has an important issue in JIRA that needs to be resolved before they ship their product to
> customers. It is critical that she does not forget about this issue before release. Watching the
> issue will not help: if nobody updates the issue then she will never be notified. The same goes
> for notification schemes. She could modify the Workflow so that all issues must go through her for
> final approval but that seems quite heavy handed and not agile at all. Instead she decides,
> finally, to just copy and paste the issue into her calendar (a time consuming process). She then
> gets annoyed as she realises that she will have to do this for every single issue in JIRA that
> she wants to be reminded about. "There must be a better way?" she asks herself.

And there is. Introducing Remind me for Cloud, a plugin designed to remind you of issues when you
ask to be reminded about them. Using this plugin you'll never forget an issue again. No issue can
slip your attention.

Install the addon now into your Cloud instance, or (if you don't have the permission to do so) ask
the admin of your Cloud instance to do it for you!
